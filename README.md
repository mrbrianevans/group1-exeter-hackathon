# Mini Hackathon
 
Contained within this repository is challenges for the Mini-Hackathon. All solutions should be written in **Python**.

## GitHub Setup

The easiest way to share code between different members of your team is through GitHub. Github allows you to commit code to a centralised repository or folder and then easy access it through your machine.

Get the username of each of your team members so you can add them to your repository when you make it later. You will need to add the following usernames to the repository too to allow for code validation and marking:

* scotland-fc
* BenConstable9
* Pyrovisionary
* mcollison

Make sure we are aware of the link to your repository during the Introduction. You only need one repository per team. We suggest you collaborate and divide up the tasks over Microsoft Teams.

## Taking Part

### How To Complete Timed (Warmup) Challenges:

The warmup challenges are timed so the team which submits their responses the quickest, will gain the most points. These are designed to get you thinking about coding in Python for the first time or again and should be fairly quick to complete.

1. Use the **Use This Template** option to create a copy of this repository. We suggest you make it **Private** so other teams cannot see your progress.
2. Open in your favourite text editor or Integrated Development Environment
3. Use the provided template files in **/tree/main/Warm-Ups** to complete the timed challenges.
4. Commit them back to your repository and make sure it is published to GitHub.
5. Make sure you have added the organisers to the repository so we can validate your code.
6. The time taken to complete the challenge will be based on when the submission is pushed to GitHub.

### Completing Non-Timed (Main) Challenges:

Once you have completed the warm-up challenges, now it is time to work on the major challenges. A set number of points is available for each of these challenges and there is no strict marking criteria. The quality of each submission will be ranked by the judges.

Please submit these in the same way as the timed challenges in the same repository. Place all files in **/tree/main/Creative-Challenges** to complete the timed challenges.

## Questions?

If you have any questions or would like some help/hints, ask them to the main channel in the Microsoft Teams and we will answer them.

### Good Luck!
